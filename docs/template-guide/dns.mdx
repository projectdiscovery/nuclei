title: "DNS"
---

DNS protocol can be modelled in nuclei with ease. Fully Customizable DNS requests can be sent by nuclei to nameservers and matching/extracting can be performed on their response.

DNS Requests start with a **dns** block which specifies the start of the requests for the template.

```yaml
# Start the requests for the template right here
dns:
```

### Type

First thing in the request is **type**. Request type can be **A**, **NS**, **CNAME**, **SOA**, **PTR**, **MX**, **TXT**, **AAAA**.

```yaml
# type is the type for the dns request
type: A
```

### Name

The next part of the requests is the DNS **name** to resolve. Dynamic variables can be placed in the path to modify its value on runtime. Variables start with `{{` and end with `}}` and are case-sensitive.

1. **FQDN** - variable is replaced by the hostname/FQDN of the target on runtime.

An example name value:

```yaml
name: {{FQDN}}.com
# This value will be replaced on execution with the FQDN.
# If FQDN is https://this.is.an.example then the
# name will get replaced to the following: this.is.an.example.com
```

As of now the tool supports only one name per request.


### Class

Class type can be **INET**, **CSNET**, **CHAOS**, **HESIOD**, **NONE** and **ANY**. Usually it's enough to just leave it as **INET**.

```yaml
# method is the class for the dns request
class: inet
```

### Recursion

Recursion is a boolean value, and determines if the resolver should only return cached results, or traverse the whole dns root tree to retrieve fresh results. Generally it's better to leave it as **true**.

```yaml
# Recursion is a boolean determining if the request is recursive
recursion: true
```

### Retries

Retries is the number of attempts a dns query is retried before giving up among different resolvers. It's recommended a reasonable value, like **3**.

```yaml
# Retries is a number of retries before giving up on dns resolution
retries: 3
```

### Matchers / Extractor Parts

Valid `part` values supported by **DNS** protocol for Matchers / Extractor are - 

| Value            | Description                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------|
| request          | DNS Request                 |
| rcode            | DNS Rcode                   |
| question         | DNS Question Message        |
| extra            | DNS Message Extra Field     |
| answer           | DNS Message Answer Field    |
| ns               | DNS Message Authority Field |
| raw / all / body | Raw DNS Message             |

### **Example DNS Template**

The final example template file for performing `A` query, and check if CNAME and A records are in the response is as follows:

```yaml
id: dummy-cname-a

info:
  name: Dummy A dns request
  author: mzack9999
  severity: none
  description: Checks if CNAME and A record is returned.

dns:
  - name: "{{FQDN}}"
    type: A
    class: inet
    recursion: true
    retries: 3
    matchers:
      - type: word
        words:
          # The response must contain a CNAME record
          - "IN\tCNAME"
          # and also at least 1 A record
          - "IN\tA"
        condition: and
```
